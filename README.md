## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Git
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/titustum/doctors-appointment-system.git 
   cd doctors-appointment-system
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Database**

   Initialize the SQLite database and create the required tables:

   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   After setting up the database, you can run the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   This will start the web server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
